#Netflix Content Strategy Analysis

This project analyzes Netflix genre performance using a business-oriented data analytics approach rather than simple exploratory analysis.

**Objective

To identify:**
1.Genres with strong long-term growth
2.Genres that accelerated during COVID
3.High-volume but volatile segments
4.Underrated investment opportunities

**Methodology**
Using Python and Pandas, the pipeline calculates:

**Year-over-year genre growth**
1.Volatility (standard deviation over time)
2.COVID momentum shift
3.Risk-adjusted opportunity scoring
4.Strategic quadrant classification

**Key Insights**
1.International Movies & Dramas dominate sustained long-term volume.
2.Select niche genres experienced disproportionate COVID acceleration.
3.Risk-adjusted scoring highlights mid-volume genres with strong strategic upside.

**Tech Stack**
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

**Strategic Framework**
Genres were classified into quadrants based on:

Average titles per year (volume)
Volatility (risk)

This enables data-driven content investment prioritization.
